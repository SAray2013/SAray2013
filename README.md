ü§ù Hello,

First I would like to introduce myself. My name's Saray Kim. Nowadays, I work full-time for Tday and I work as a software engineer. Most of my work consists of coding and application management. I usually deal with business owners and customer service. I'm currently researching artificial intelligence solutions to help save our planet.

Thank you.
